# Modeling Drosophila Germline Stem Cell Differentiation

## Overview
This project simulates the differentiation process of Drosophila melanogaster germline stem cells (GSCs) into cystoblasts, nurse cells, and oocytes. The simulation incorporates key biological factors such as chromatin state, transposable element activity, and metabolic changes, providing insights into the dynamics of stem cell differentiation.

## Key Features
- Simulates the differentiation of GSCs over a defined number of time steps.
- Models the effects of chromatin opening, transposable element activity, and metabolic reprogramming on differentiation rates.
- Visualizes the population dynamics of GSCs, cystoblasts, nurse cells, and oocytes over time.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
To run the simulation, execute the following Python script:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


## Results
The simulation visualizes the dynamics of GSC differentiation over time, showing how the populations of GSCs, cystoblasts, nurse cells, and oocytes change. The results can provide insights into the regulatory mechanisms governing stem cell behavior and differentiation.
